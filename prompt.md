# PHP Language Server Protocol (LSP) Server - Specification-Driven Development (SDD) Prompt

## Project Overview

This is a custom Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for PHP, implemented in Rust using `async-lsp` and following Specification-Driven Development (SDD) principles with `spec-kit-plus`. The goal is to create a lightweight, modular, and hackable LSP that provides full PHP language support comparable to PHPStorm's built-in capabilities.

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Rust
- **LSP Framework**: `async-lsp` (v0.2.2)
- **Syntax Parsing**: `tree-sitter` (v0.25.10) and `tree-sitter-php` (v0.24.2)
- **SDD Framework**: `spec-kit-plus` (for specification-driven development)
- **Target Editor**: Zed.dev integration

## SDD Constitutional Principles

### Article I: Library-First Principle
- Every feature must begin as a standalone library—no exceptions
- The LSP server must be modular with clear boundaries and minimal dependencies

### Article II: CLI Interface Mandate
- All components must expose functionality through a command-line interface
- Support text input/output and JSON format for structured data exchange
- Ensure observability and testability of all functionality

### Article III: Test-First Imperative
- All implementation MUST follow strict Test-Driven Development
- No implementation code shall be written before:
  1. Unit tests are written and validated
  2. Tests are approved by the user
  3. Tests are confirmed to FAIL (Red phase)

### Articles VII & VIII: Simplicity and Anti-Abstraction
- Maximum 3 projects for initial implementation
- Use `async-lsp` framework features directly rather than wrapping them
- Single model representation for each concept

### Article IX: Integration-First Testing
- Prioritize real-world testing over isolated unit tests
- Use real LSP clients (Zed) for testing rather than mocks
- Contract tests mandatory before implementation

## Core LSP Features Required

- Support for PHP 8+ features (attributes, named parameters, union types, etc.)
- PHPDoc-based completions incorporating type information from documentation
- Framework-specific completions (WordPress hooks, actions, filters)
- Composer dependency-based completions

### 4. Hover Information
- Function/method signature information with parameter types and return types
- PHPDoc content display for functions, classes, methods, and properties

- Type inference display for variables and expressions

### 5. Go-to-Definition
- Navigate to function, method, class, property, and constant definitions
- Support for WordPress hooks and filters (actions/filters declared with add_action/add_filter)
- Navigate to custom hooks defined in the codebase
- Cross-file navigation within the workspace

### 6. Document Symbols
- Hierarchical symbol outline for PHP files (classes, methods, properties, constants, functions)
- Support for namespace organization
- Ability to search and navigate to symbols within the document

### 7. Workspace Symbols
- Global symbol search across the entire workspace
- Indexing of all project symbols for fast lookup
- Support for searching classes, functions, interfaces, traits, etc.

### 8. Find References
- Locate all references to functions, methods, classes, variables, etc.
- Support for finding hook/function usage in WordPress context

### 9. Signature Help
- Parameter information during function/method calls
- Support for overloaded functions and methods
- Display of PHPDoc for parameters during signature help

### 10. Document Formatting (Future)
- Integration with code formatters (php-cs-fixer, rector)
- Support for project-specific formatting rules

## PHP-Specific Requirements

### PHP Version Support
- Automatic detection of PHP version from composer.json
- Adapt completions, syntax checking, and diagnostics based on specified PHP version
- Support for PHP 8+ features when version is 8.0 or higher

### PHPDoc Integration
- Comprehensive parsing of PHPDoc comments
- Type information extraction from `@param`, `@return`, `@var`, `@property`, etc.
- Support for complex type expressions and generics
- Integration with static analysis tools (PHPStan, Psalm)

### Framework Integration

#### WordPress Support
- Advanced completion and navigation for WordPress hooks system
- Recognition and completion of core WordPress functions, hooks, and constants
- Navigate from hook usage to hook definition (add_action/add_filter)
- Support for custom action and filter definitions
- Context-aware completions based on hook type and parameters

#### Future Framework Support
- Modular architecture to support other frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, etc.)
- Pluggable framework detection and feature enhancement

### Extension Detection
- Detect PHP extensions in use but not declared in composer.json
- Provide warnings and suggestions to update composer.json
- Support for extension-specific completions and documentation

## Architecture & Design

### Specification-Driven Development Approach
- Use `spec-kit-plus` for defining and testing LSP capabilities
- Define behavior specifications before implementation
- Iterative development approach with specification refinement
- Comprehensive testing of LSP protocol compliance

### Async Architecture
- Leverage `async-lsp`'s async-native design for optimal performance
- Handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently
- Maintain responsive user experience during analysis

### Modularity
- Clean, router-style handler architecture
- Pluggable analysis components
- Extensible framework support
- Configurable feature sets per project

## Zed Editor Integration

### Direct LSP Integration
- Binary executable that Zed can invoke as a language server
- Proper handling of Zed-specific LSP extensions
- Optimal performance for Zed's editing experience

### Potential Zed Extensions
- Configuration options via Zed's language settings
- Custom keybindings for PHP-specific actions
- Integration with Zed's project management features

## SDD Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Feature Specification
- Use `/sp.specify` command to create structured feature specifications
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY, avoiding HOW to implement
- Include user stories and acceptance criteria
- Mark unclear requirements with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] tags

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning
- Use `/sp.plan` command to generate comprehensive implementation plans
- Ensure constitutional compliance (Library-first, Test-first, etc.)
- Convert business requirements to technical architecture
- Generate API contracts and data models
- Create research documents for technical decisions

### Phase 3: Task Generation
- Use `/sp.tasks` command to create executable task lists
- Convert contracts and scenarios into specific tasks
- Mark independent tasks for parallelization
- Generate `tasks.md` in feature directories

### Phase 4: Implementation with SDD Principles
- Follow test-first development (Article III)
- Create libraries first, then applications (Article I)
- Ensure CLI interfaces for all components (Article II)
- Use integration testing with real LSP client (Article IX)
